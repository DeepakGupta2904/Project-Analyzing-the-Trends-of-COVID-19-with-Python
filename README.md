I am done this project as a Data Scientist Intern at Intellipaat Software Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

Technologies:- Data Science

Domain:- Medical and Hospitity

Tools:- Python (Jupiter Notebook)

Problem Statement: Given data about COVID-19 patients, write code to visualize the impact and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current trends. This data about the number of COVID-19 confirmed deaths and recovered patients both around the world and in India.

Guidelines:-

 1. Usepandas to accumulate data from multiple data files.
 2. Useplotly (visualization library) to create interactive visualizations.
 3. UseFacebook prophet library to make time series models.
 4. Visualize the prediction by combining these technologies.
